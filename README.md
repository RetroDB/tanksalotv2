# TanksALot
A One-week group project developed after classes in our “spare-time”.

// The Idea
The game was meant to be a throwback to old school from the Nintendo NES console, a game called BatleCity, with a minimalistic graphical UI and minimal gameplay information. In which we need to control a tank and shoot enemy tanks.
